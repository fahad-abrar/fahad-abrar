Hey, I'm a skilled backend developer and data scientist with a strong foundation in designing and implementing scalable and efficient solutions. My expertise spans across modern backend technologies, including Node.js, Express.js, Django REST Framework, and Prisma, along with experience in managing databases using MongoDB, SQL, and Redis.
I am well-versed in real-time data streaming and messaging systems like Kafka and RabbitMQ, which I leverage to build robust and responsive applications. My proficiency in Python allows me to integrate advanced data science techniques, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), into backend systems, providing data-driven insights and enhancing the intelligence of applications.
I am passionate about building seamless and powerful backend infrastructures that not only meet business requirements but also adapt to future needs.
